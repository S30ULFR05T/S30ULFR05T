👋 Hello there! I'm Suraj Kumar, a passionate B.Tech student with a knack for Frontend Development and UI Design. Currently on the journey towards my 2024 graduation, I'm dedicated to creating intuitive user experiences and visually appealing designs.

💻 My expertise lies in JavaScript and Python, which I leverage to build interactive and responsive websites. Beyond coding, I'm adept at using tools like Figma, VSDC, Filmora, and Canva for design and video editing projects.

🌟 I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, designers, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, contribute to open-source projects, and embark on new learning adventures together.

🚀 Let's connect and code something awesome!
