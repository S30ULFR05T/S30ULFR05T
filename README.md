ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Suraj Kumar, a passionate B.Tech student with a knack for Frontend Development and UI Design. Currently on the journey towards my 2024 graduation, I'm dedicated to creating intuitive user experiences and visually appealing designs.

ðŸ’» My expertise lies in JavaScript and Python, which I leverage to build interactive and responsive websites. Beyond coding, I'm adept at using tools like Figma, VSDC, Filmora, and Canva for design and video editing projects.

ðŸŒŸ I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, designers, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas, contribute to open-source projects, and embark on new learning adventures together.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and code something awesome!
